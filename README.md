#TETRIS

Our project is meant to be a recreation of the classic game Tetris that many know and love. Our setup is a relatively simple version of the game, so without all of those weird powerups and distracting backgrounds you see popping up everywhere.
Our game works through a driver of several files on Processing. The Tetris driver uses other files to connect how an outside user can interact with the game with how the pieces are used to achieve the goal of keeping the level down as much as possible (unless your goal is to lose, but we're all winners here). 

#Launch Instructions
To launch the game, all you have to do is press play on Processing, and select a game mode. From there, all systems go, and you're free to play.

#How to Play
In Tetris, the object of the game is to put given shapes together to form full rows. When a row is full, it will be cleared and everything above that row will move down one row. A shape will appear at the top in the middle and begin to move down slowly. The user can use the left/right arrow keys to move the shape, and the up arrow key to rotate the shape. Hitting the space bar will drop the shape all the way down wherever it was and whatever its rotation was. Points will be accumulated from clearing rows, so of course the goal here is to get the most points. Have fun!
