# TETRIS

Our project is meant to be a recreation of the classic game Tetris that many know and love. Our setup is a relatively simple version of the game, so without all of those weird powerups and distracting backgrounds you see popping up everywhere. Just sit back and enjoy :)
# How it Works
Our game works through a driver of several files on Processing. The Tetris driver uses other files to connect how a user can interact with the game, along with how the pieces are used to achieve the goal of keeping the top level down as much as possible (unless your goal is to lose, but we're all winners here). 

# Launch Instructions
1. Hit the play button from processing
2. Click with the mouse on the play button to start the game, which will begin immediately
3. Use the arrow keys and space bar to operate, and get a high score!

# How to Play
In Tetris, the object of the game is to put given shapes together to form full rows. When a row is full, it will be cleared and everything above that row will move down one row. A shape will appear at the top in the middle and begin to move down slowly. The user can use the left/right arrow keys to move the shape, and the up arrow key to rotate the shape. Hitting the space bar will drop the shape all the way down wherever it was and whatever its rotation was. Move up levels for bragging rights by clearing the most rows. Have fun!
